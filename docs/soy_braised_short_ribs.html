            <blockquote>
            <p>For the best results, start seasoning the meat the night before. Clean up the short ribs of any sinew or fat cap and then season all sides of the meat with a touch of salt and let it sit in the first uncovered overnight.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>The next day when ready to cook, combine the mirin, soy sauce, Sugar, whites of the scallions, ginger, garlic, and water and mix to combine.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and also get a large oven-safe heavy bottoms pot like a dutch oven preheating on medium to medium-high heat. Once hot add a touch of oil and then begin to sear the short ribs until deeply browned on all sides. Then remove the short ribs from the pot and drain the pot of any excess oil. Then add the braising liquid, making sure you get all the sugar that may have settled to the bottom. Then add the short ribs back to the pot and bring to a simmer. While it comes up to a simmer you can strain any foam or impurities that rise to the top but it’s not necessary. Once simmering, place a lid on and cook in the 300-degree oven for 3 hours but we are going to set a timer for 2 1/2 hours. After 2 1/2 hours check the meat and remove the lid and continue cooking uncovered in the oven for the final 30 minutes. After 3 hours, check the tenderness of the meat. A fork should go in and out of the meat with zero resistance, like a hot knife through butter. Then remove the meat, strain the liquid in a fat separator if you have one (a bowl will work, just skim off most of the fat or let cool in the fridge if making ahead). Let it sit while you prepare the rice and broccolini and garnishes.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>For the curled scallions, use the greens only. Slice them down the middle lengthwise and then fold them on top of each other and thinly slice into strips. Then place in cold water for 5 minutes or until they begin to curl. Then remove from the water and dry with paper towels and let them sit in the fridge until you’re ready to use them.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Rinse the rice extremely well. Once you can see a good amount of the starch has been rinsed off, drain it and get it into a good heavy bottom small to mid-sized pot with a well-fitting lid. Then add an equal amount of water. Get it on the stove on high and bring it to a light boil. Stir to make sure nothing sticks. Once gently boiling, shut the heat off for a moment, place a kitchen towel over the pot, then place the lid tightly on top of the towel. Then fold the towel over the lid and then place a small plate on top to make sure it doesn’t unfold. Turn the heat back on to its lowest setting possible and cook for exactly 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, turn off the heat and move it to a cool burner and then let it rest and steam for an additional 10 minutes. After that it should be perfectly cooked, it shouldn’t but stuck to the bottom of the pot and it shouldn’t be mushy.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>In a separate pan over medium to medium-high heat, add some olive oil, the broccolini, and a touch of salt, and begin to cook the broccolini. You want a little char on the broccolini and to get them softened but with a bit of a bite still remaining in the stems. It should take 8-10 minutes. Once 80% cooked, add sliced garlic and chili flake and continue cooking until the garlic is lightly browned, then get it off the heat and finish up the dish.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>In another pan, add the braising liquid that has separated from the fat (save the fat, that’s pure beef tallow). Bring up to a simmer. While coming up to a simmer, mix 2 tbsp.<code>of cornstarch with 2 tbsp.</code> of cold water. Stir to combine and then whisk into the braising liquid. Once the liquid reaches a high enough temp the slurry will start to do its job and thicken the sauce. Transfer the meat back into the sauce to reheat and glaze before serving.</p>

            <p>Place with some rice, some broccolini, a piece of the meat with some of the sauce drizzled on top and finished with sesame seed and the curled scallions.</p>
