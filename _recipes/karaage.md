> Cut each chicken thigh into 2-inch pieces and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

---

> Grate the ginger (you will only need 1/2 tsp) and mince the garlic (I use a garlic presser).

---

> In a large bowl, combine ginger, garlic, 1/2 tbsp. soy sauce, 1/2 tbsp. sake, and 1/2 tsp. sesame oil. Whisk all together.

---

> Add the chicken to the bowl and mix with your hands. Cover and keep in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes.

---

> Meanwhile, prepare potato starch and all-purpose flour in separate piles.

---

> First, lightly dredge each chicken piece in the flour and dust off the excess flour. Then dredge the chicken in the potato starch and remove excess starch.

---

> Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot (I used a Dutch oven) and heat the oil to 325ºF (163ºC) on medium heat.

---

> When the oil temperature has reached 325ºF (163ºC) (insert a wooden chopstick in the oil and see if small bubbles appear around it) gently submerge each chicken piece into the oil. Do not overcrowd; add 3-5 pieces at a time. If you put many pieces in the oil, the oil temperature will drop quickly and chicken will end up absorbing too much oil.

---

> First Deep Frying: Deep fry for 90 seconds, or until the outside of the chicken is a light golden color. If the chicken changes color too quickly, then the oil temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces of chicken in the oil or lower the heat. Controlling oil temperature at all times is very important for deep frying. Transfer to a wire rack to drain excess oil.

---

> The chicken will continue to cook with the remaining heat on the wire rack. Continue with the remaining chicken. Between batches, pick up crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh sieve. This keeps the oil clean and prevents it from becoming darker.

---

> 2nd Deep Frying: Now heat the oil to 350ºF (177ºC). Deep fry for 45 seconds, or until the skin is nice golden color and crispy. Transfer to a wire rack to drain excess oil and continue with the remaining chicken.

> Chicken on the left is after the 1st frying and one on the right is after the 2nd frying. You can see the chicken is slightly darker in color.
