* `4 quarts` skimmed milk
* `3/4 cup` plain skyr
* `4 drops` liquid vegetarian rennet
* `1/4 cup` lukewarm water (at 97 F / 36째C)

---

> In a non-stick saucepan, bring the milk to a boil, at a temperature between 185 F and 210 F (85째C and 100째C) maximum. This step should take about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the milk regularly with a metal spoon to prevent it from sticking or burning. Towards the end of this step, if the milk starts to stick to the bottom of the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low and stop stirring.

---

> Remove the pan from the heat and allow the milk to cool to a temperature of 115 F (45째C).

---

> Pour the plain skyr into a bowl. Once the milk has cooled, pour 1 cup (250 ml) of cooled milk over the skyr and mix. Pour the liquid rennet into lukewarm water and whisk, then immediately pour this mixture into the milk while whisking (the rennet loses its effectiveness very quickly).

---

> This mixture should sit for 12 hours before proceeding to the rest of the recipe.

---

> To do this, cover the pan with a thick cotton cloth and place it in a warm, draft-free place for 12 hours. During these 12 hours of rest, the curd separates from the whey, which is necessary for the manufacture of skyr.

---

> Pour the curd thus obtained into the cheesecloth. Hang the cheesecloth on a roasting pan in a cool room, or place the cheesecloth in a colander over a large bowl in the refrigerator. Allow the remaining whey to drain until the skyr is ready, and is very thick.

---

> The skyr will keep for 3 weeks, covered, in the refrigerator.
