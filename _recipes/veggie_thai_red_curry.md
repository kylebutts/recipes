> Cook rice.

---

> To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once itâ€™s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.

---

> Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.

---

> Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers, carrots and kale have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

---

> Remove the pot from the heat and season with soy sauce and rice vinegar. Add salt (I added 1/4 tsp.` for optimal flavor), to taste. If the curry needs a little more punch, add 1/2 tsp.` more soy sauce, or for more acidity, add 1/2 tsp.` more rice vinegar. Divide rice and curry into bowls and garnish with basil. If you love spicy curries, serve with sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.
