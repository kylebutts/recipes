* `1 quart` heavy cream (better the cream, the better)
* `3/4 cup` plain skyr (e.g. sigi)

---


> In a glass bowl or mason jar, whisk cream with skyr. You can also use buttermilk, but sigi is better. Cover bowl with a towel and allow to sit at room temperature for 24 hours, until thickened.

---

> Place mixture in refrigerator for at least three hours, preferably overnight, until completely chilled.

---

> Pour all of the cream into a food processor and turn it on (use high speed for multi-speed food processors). Watch as the mixture first looks like whipped cream, then eventually separates into butter and buttermilk. This process takes about three to five 
minutes. Don't mix too long or butter can lose shape.

---

> Pour off as much buttermilk as possible. Place the remaining butter in cheesecloth, or a fine-mesh strainer, and drain and squeeze out as much buttermilk as possible.

---

> Remove butter from the cheesecloth and rinse a few times with ice-cold water, pouring off and discarding excess fluid. Knead the butter, or use a spatula to press it against the side of the bowl, to discard even more liquid. Squeezing out all of the 
buttermilk will help extend the life of the butter.

> Serve at room temperature, salting to taste. Richer mixes about Â¼ teaspoon of fine sea-salt into the fresh butter, then sprinkles on some coarse sea salt right before serving.
